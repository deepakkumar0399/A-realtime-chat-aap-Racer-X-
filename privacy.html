    <h3>Information Racer-X Collects</h3>
    <p>At the end of an Racer-X chat, you or the other user may choose to save the text contents of the chat to Racer-X
        servers (a “Saved Chatlog”). A URL is generated for each Saved Chatlog.
        <b>A Saved Chatlog may contain any category of personal information you chose to share during the chat. You and
            the
            other user may disclose a Saved Chatlog or any information shared during the chat. In addition to the Saved
            Chatlog, it is possible for the other user to take screenshots or use third party software to broadcast or
            record chats. Be careful with the information you share with a stranger during a chat.</b>
    </p>
    <p>In addition to any information contained in a Saved Chatlog, within the last twelve (12) months, Racer-X has
        collected the following categories of personal information from the following sources and disclosed for a
        business purpose to the following third parties:</p>

    <p>Racer-X uses an ID Cookie to randomly assign your device browser an online identifier. Racer-X uses the online
        identifier for website and chat services safety and security purposes.</p>
    <p>Racer-X uses Interest Cookies which allow you to save your interests and preferences while using the chat

        for the set of overlapping interests captured in a Saved Chatlog, Racer-X does not save information from Interest
        cookies and only accesses the information for the purpose of fulfilling requests to chat using the common
        interest feature.</p>
    <p>Racer-X uses College Cookies which allow you to save your preferences when using college mode and identifies your
        college’s domain name if you choose to use college mode. Your college domain name will be disclosed to the other
        user in your chat. Except for disclosure of your college domain name captured in a Saved Chatlog, Racer-X does
        not save information from College Cookies and only accesses the information for the purpose of fulfilling
        request to chat using the college mode feature.</p>
